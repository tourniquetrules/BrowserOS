High‑level vision: browser OS, tech stack (e.g., Vite + React + TS).

Coding style, testing expectations, and how you want commits structured.

Explicit instructions that Claude should:

Propose an architecture and file tree first.

Implement features in small, reviewable steps.

Keep everything self-contained and front‑end only for now.
